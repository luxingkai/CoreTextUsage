     Paragraph or ruler attributes in an attributed string.
     
     A paragraph style object represents a complex attribute
     value in an attributed string, storing a number of
     subattributes that affect paragraph layout for the
     characters of the string. Among these subattributes
     are alignment, tab stops, writing direction, line-breaking
     mode, and indentation settings.

#pragma mark    -- Creating Paragraph Styles
    
    /**
     CTParagraphStyleCreate
     Creates an immutable paragraph style.
     
     Using this function is the easiest and most efficient way
     to create a paragraph style. Paragraph styles should be
     kept immutable for totally lock-free operation. If an
     invalid paragraph style setting specifier is passed
     into the settings parameter, nothing bad will happen,
     but you will be unable to query for this value. The
     reason is to allow backward compatibility with style
     setting specifiers that may be introduced in future versions.

#pragma mark -- Getting the value of a Style Specifier
    
    /**
     CTParagraphStyleGetValueForSpecifier
     Obtains the current value for a single setting specifier.

     This function returns the current value of the specifier
     whether or not the user actually set it. If the user
     did not set the specifier, this function returns the
     default value. If an invalid paragraph style setting
     specifier is passed into the spec parameter, nothing
     bad happens, and the buffer value is simply zeroed out.
     The reason is to allow backward compatibility with
     style setting specifiers that may be introduced in
     future versions.

     Each specifier has a type and a default value associated
     with it. The type must always be observed when setting or
     fetching the value from the CTParagraphStyle object. In
     addition, some specifiers affect the behavior of both the
     framesetter and the typesetter, and others affect the behavior
     of only the framesetter, as noted in the constant descriptions.
