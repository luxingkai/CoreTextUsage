     Generate text frames.

     CTFramesetter is an object factory for CTFrame objects.
     The framesetter takes an attributed string object and a shape
     descriptor object and calls into the typesetter to create
     line objects that fill that shape. The output is a frame
     object containing an array of lines. The frame can then
     draw itself directly into the current graphic context.

     CTFramesetterCreateWithAttributedString
     
     Creates an immutable framesetter object from an
     attributed string.

     The resultant framesetter object can be used to create
     and fill text frames with the CTFramesetterCreateFrame call.

     Creates a framesetter directly from a typesetter.
     
     Each framesetter uses a typesetter internally to perform
     line breaking and other contextual analysis based on the
     characters in a string. This function allows the framesetter
     to use a typesetter that was constructed using specific options.

     CTFramesetterCreateFrame
     Creates an immutable frame using a framesetter.
     
     This call creates a frame full of glyphs in the shape
     of the path provided by the path parameter. The framesetter
     continues to fill the frame until it either runs out of
     text or it finds that text no longer fits.

     In versions of macOS prior to 10.7 and versions of iOS
     prior to 4.2, this function returns NULL if the CGPath
     specified by the path parameter is not rectangular.

     breaking and other contextual analysis based on the characters

     perform other operations on that typesetter.
